- I start with a scan of the open ports,
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p- --open -vvv -sS --min-rate 5000 -Pn -oG scan 192.168.56.105 -oG scan
    ```

- Scanning open ports.
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p22,80,31337 -sCV 192.168.56.105 -oN ports
    ```

- I look at what technologies they are using on the two websites.
    
    ```bash
    whatweb http://192.168.56.105/
    whatweb http://192.168.56.105:31337/
    ```

- I access to the website and follow the displayed message.

- From the name of the image I interpret that I have to go to the other site since it uses that port.

- I enter the page and search in the source code until I find a string in base 64

- Looking at the contents of the file I see that it has an encryption called brainfuck
    
    ![image 9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64ba1b20-ccb4-47d8-b4f5-5f3ac1c812a5)

    

- I decrypt it to see its content

- I create a python script to generate all possible password combinations for the user guest
    
    ![image 11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5203b8d-ff01-4450-9ee7-a6e0b942fb58)

    

- I use hydra to see what this user's password is and once I find it, I log in via ssh.

- On entering I see that I have a very limited shell. After trying several things I enter vi to spawn a bash to which I export a generic path for convenience.
    
    ```bash
    :!/bin/bash
    ```

- To escalate privileges I look for files that have permission to execute the file as another user and we found 3 potential paths.
