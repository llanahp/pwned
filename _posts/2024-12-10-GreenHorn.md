- I start with a scan of the open ports,
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p- --open -vvv -sS --min-rate 5000 -Pn 10.10.11.25 -oG scan
    ```

- I continue with a scan of the versions and technologies that are running on the open ports that we have found
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p22,80.3000 -sCV 10.10.11.25 -oN ports
    ```

- I found the domain `greenhorn.htb` and add it to the file in the `/etc/hosts` file
- I look at what technologies they are using on the website.
    
    ```bash
    whatweb http://greenhorn.htb/
    ```

- I find a panel to log in and little else. I look at the other site that uses port 3000 and I see that it is running a `Gitea`
- Looking at the GreenHorn repository files I find a hash apparently in sha512, when I run it through `crackStation` it tells me that the plaintext password of this hash is `iloveyou1`

- Thanks to this password and searching for the Pluck version I find a vulnerability that allows to make a RCE. [Pluck v4.7.18 - Remote Code Execution (RCE)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51592)

- I use this exploit to create a revershell and manage to log in as www-data

- I see that you exist as a junior user. I find in the junior directory a pdf that I can read, bring it to my place and open it.

- I find a fuzzy password. After searching for various tools that can reverse this I found [Deprix](https://github.com/spipm/Depix)
    
    ![image 8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90bee5b7-d7d6-4ebb-8a04-73c088dd57b3)

    
- To this tool we pass an image of the blur we want to reverse, using pdfimages, and a sample of the ones it has. After several different combinations I manage to get an image in which we can get to know the password. We try with “sidefromsidetheothersidesidefromsidetheotherside” and now we are root and we can read the second flag.
